PCIe messaging layer

a. Introduction
_____________________________________________________

This is the PCI based messaging layer module built on top of dolphin interconnect solution

This can be built as a standalone kernel module on vanilla linux for testing the msg layer or as part of popcorn linux using compile time MACROS

b. Folder Contents
_____________________________________________________

msg_layer.c
pcn_kmsg.h < same as kernel linux/pcn_kmsg.h header file >
Makefile


c. MACROS Description
_____________________________________________________

1. TARGET_NODE:
	The dolphin solution's node ID for the target machine.
	The node ID of a dolphin installation can be found by going to /opt/DIS/sbin and running ./dis_status. Look for Local Node ID.
	In our setup, node ID currently for ARM is 8 and x86 is 4.
 
2. TEST_MSG_LAYER:
	Macro to enable independent installation and testing.
	Where TEST_SERVER macro is enabled, this prints the average ping-pong latency and throughput for each message.
	Each channel sends 25000 messages, set using NUM_MSGS macro

3. TEST_SERVER:
	When enabled along with TEST_MSG_LAYER, the module acts as server. It send messages and waits for the return reply from client before printing average
	The other end module should be set as client by setting TEST_SERVER to zero. Then the client will wait for the messages and sends a reply for each message it recieves.
	The message size set by MSG_LENGTH and NUM_MSGS should be same on both sides.

4. PROF_HISTOGRAM:
	When TEST_MSG_LAYER and TEST_SERVER macros are set, this macro prints the latency of each message sent to give a profile and not just the average value.
	Reduce number of messages 

5. ENABLE_DMA:
	When set, uses DMA instead of PIO for messaging. Default is PIO transfer (as it is faster)

6. MAX_NUM_CHANNELS:
	Number of dolphin channels used for messaging. Currently set to 4. Set it equal to number of cores.
 
5. NUM_MSGS:
	Number of messages to be sent per channel


d. BUILD
_______________________________________________________

Ensure that all the header files needed for dolphin APIs are available in place.
The folders where necessary header files are kept can be found in EXTRA_FLAGS description in the current make file.
The base folder in current makefile is - /home/ssrg_lab/dolphin/

The above needed header files can be got from the dolphin installation script by getting tarball using the command -

#./script.sh --get-tarball

2. After Makefile is modified, Make the modules using -

#make clean; make

3. Then insert the messaging layer modules using -

#insmod msg_layer.ko

4. while testing independently, you can remove module using -

#rmmod msg_layer.ko
